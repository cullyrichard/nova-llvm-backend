"""Reorder llc's Eclipse assembly output so all `var` (page-zero data)
declarations come before all code — required because `LDA`/`STA ac,addr`
default to page-zero (absolute, 8-bit-displacement) addressing, and dgasm
assigns addresses strictly in the order lines appear in the source file
(confirmed by reading dgasm's assembler.c directly: current_address starts
at `org` and increments statement-by-statement). llc's normal per-function
emission order interleaves each function's own constant-pool `var` lines
with its code, and the module-wide jump table at the very end — meaning
growing code can silently push a `var` line past address 255 (the largest
page-zero displacement) and dgasm will reject the file with "Address out
of range".

This is pure line-oriented text manipulation, not a code transformation:
the fixed preamble (comments, `org`, `dev`, `_start`, the initial `_SP`/
`_scratch` declarations) stays exactly first, then every remaining `var `
line moves before every remaining non-`var` line, each group keeping its
own original relative order. See llvm/lib/Target/Eclipse/EclipseAsmPrinter.h
in the Eclipse LLVM backend for why this lives here instead of in the
backend itself.

Full pipeline (see main(), and each stage's own section below):
sanitize_identifiers -> reorder -> dedup_constants -> relax_long_jumps ->
fix_stack_pointer.
dedup_constants merges byte-identical constant-pool entries that LLVM's
per-function MachineConstantPool emits independently in every function
that happens to use the same literal value — confirmed to reclaim 100+
duplicate page-zero words in real programs (see its own section below).
relax_long_jumps must run after dedup_constants since it computes real
addresses from the final line layout, and removing duplicate lines
changes addresses. fix_stack_pointer must run last of all, for the same
"final addresses only" reason, plus one more: relax_long_jumps can itself
grow the program (new long-jump slots), which shifts where the program's
data actually ends — see fix_stack_pointer's own section below for why
that end address matters.

# --- long-jump relaxation -------------------------------------------------
#
# dgasm's default JMP addressing is PC-relative with an 8-bit *signed*
# displacement (-128..127 words from the word after the JMP itself) —
# fine for a small function, but a big one (e.g. eclipse_rt.c's printf/
# scanf, dozens of basic blocks) can put a loop's back-edge or a
# conditional branch's target out of that range: real dgasm rejects it
# with "Address out of range".
#
# Making *every* internal jump indirect (through a page-zero pointer
# slot, the same trick CALL already uses for every function) was tried
# first and doesn't scale: one slot per distinct branch target, and a
# library with enough functions has enough of those to overflow the
# 256-word page-zero budget on its own — confirmed empirically. So this
# only converts the *specific* jumps that are actually out of range,
# computing real addresses by replicating dgasm's own pass1 statement
# sizing (confirmed by reading its assembler.c directly, not assumed):
# STMT_LABEL and `dev` lines are zero-width; a string `var` is
# `len(string)+1` words; everything else (a real instruction, or a
# numeric/symbol `var`) is exactly 1 word. Iterates to a fixed point,
# since inserting a new slot's `var` line shifts every later address and
# can turn a previously in-range jump out of range too.

# --- constant-pool deduplication -------------------------------------------
#
# LLVM's MachineConstantPool is *per function* — the same literal value
# (e.g. the exponent bias, a hidden-bit mask half, a loop bound) used in
# several different functions gets a separate, independently-named CPI
# entry in each one, even though the value is byte-identical. Confirmed
# empirically on eclipse_rt.c's soft-float section (which reuses a small
# set of constants extremely heavily across sf_add/sf_mul/sf_div/
# __fixsfsi/print_float/...): well over 100 duplicate single-word page-
# zero slots in one real program, out of a 256-word total budget.
#
# Every CPI entry is exactly one 16-bit word — EclipseAsmPrinter::
# emitConstantPool emits one `var CPIn_m = value` line per
# MachineConstantPool entry, and this backend's type legalizer splits any
# wider-than-i16 constant into independent i16 halves *before* it reaches
# the constant pool (confirmed by reading emitConstantPool directly: it
# only ever handles a plain ConstantInt via getSExtValue(), never a
# multi-word value) — so entries are safe to dedupe purely by value, with
# no multi-word grouping/pairing to worry about. And every *reference* is
# a bare `LDA/STA ac,CPIn_m` symbol operand — confirmed by grepping real
# generated assembly for every CPI use, none are offset against a
# neighboring entry (e.g. no `CPIn_m+1`) — so nothing depends on any two
# CPI entries being adjacent or a fixed distance apart, and a plain
# "rename every reference to the surviving symbol" is sufficient.
#
# Other page-zero `var` kinds (*_SLOT, *_PTR, *_offN) are deliberately
# NOT touched here: their symbol names are already derived from their
# target (e.g. `var foo_SLOT = foo`), so LLVM's own symbol table already
# gives them natural, automatic sharing — a given target only ever gets
# one slot declaration no matter how many call/reference sites there
# are. CPI entries are the one kind that's genuinely duplicated today,
# because MachineConstantPool has no equivalent cross-function identity.
#
# Runs after reorder() (so the var lines this cares about are already
# gathered together) and before relax_long_jumps() (which computes exact
# addresses from the *final* line layout — it must see the post-dedup
# file, not count the soon-to-be-removed duplicate lines).

# --- stack-pointer placement -----------------------------------------------
#
# Bug found while verifying bug #8's fix (see SOFT_FLOAT_NOTES.md): with
# only two allocatable registers (AC0/AC1), almost everything on this
# target spills to a software stack, implemented as a page-zero cell
# (`_SP`) holding the current top-of-stack address, pushed/popped via
# `STA n,@_SP` / `DSZ _SP,0` (see EclipseAsmPrinter.cpp's call-lowering).
# `EclipseAsmPrinter::emitStartOfAsmFile` always hardcoded its *initial*
# value to `020000` (8192 decimal) — chosen once, with no relationship to
# how much data the final program would actually contain.
#
# reorder() above deliberately moves every *bulk* (non-page-zero) global —
# every string literal and file-scope static, i.e. everything that isn't a
# page-zero pointer slot or constant-pool entry — to the very end of the
# file, so dgasm deposits it at the *highest* addresses the program uses.
# That address grows with the linked program's size (more functions
# pulled in — even ones genuinely dead at runtime: `eclipse-cc`'s
# symbol-protection mechanism has to keep a libcall's own code reachable
# to satisfy dgasm's "Undefined symbol" check even for a program that
# never actually reaches it, e.g. protecting `__ltsf2` for a `<`
# comparison also pulls in `sf_cmp` and its own helpers). Nothing before
# this pass ever compared that growing address against the fixed 8192
# stack origin sitting right above it: a small program leaves a large gap,
# but a large enough one can shrink that gap until ordinary call/recursion
# depth (e.g. `print_uint32`'s one-recursive-call-per-decimal-digit)
# drives the stack pointer down *into* that data — silently corrupting
# live globals and strings, and, once deep enough, a saved return address,
# producing exactly the "a string prints with garbled characters, then
# execution runs away to the reset vector" failure this was found from.
# Confirmed directly: examining word 0102 (the cell holding the live `_SP`
# value) mid-run on the failing repro showed it reaching decimal 7605
# while that same program's own data extended to 7755 — the stack had
# already descended into live data before the eventual crash. dgasm itself
# never catches this: unlike the hard page-zero (0-255) ceiling it
# enforces for every `LDA`/`STA` displacement, it has no equivalent check
# for "does the stack collide with static data" — to dgasm, both are just
# plain memory words.
#
# Fixed here, not in the backend: EclipseAsmPrinter emits _SP's value long
# before the final program layout exists (dedup_constants and
# relax_long_jumps haven't run yet, and it has no way to know what else
# will or won't end up linked in). This pass runs last of all, once
# compute_addresses can see the *actual* final end-of-program address, and
# repoints `_SP` comfortably above it instead of trusting a fixed guess.
# dgasm's own MAX_MEMORY_WORDS (confirmed by reading assembler.c directly)
# is 65536 — this ISA's full 16-bit address space — so there's abundant
# room: STACK_MARGIN below leaves far more headroom than any call/
# recursion depth this backend's calling convention could plausibly reach
# (the failing repro above only ever descended a few hundred words before
# corrupting something), while still failing loudly — instead of silently
# emitting an invalid or wrapped address — on the pathological case of a
# program whose own data nearly fills that space outright.
