 * modifier, not promoted/truncated the way the others are). Every
 * other type is promoted to int/pointer per the usual C varargs
 * default-argument-promotion rules, which this target's uniformly-
 * 16-bit int/pointer sizes satisfy trivially — pass a genuinely
 * 16-bit-sized value to %u/%x (not a bare out-of-int-range literal
 * like 65535, which C promotes to long) or the va_arg reads
 * downstream desync.
 *
 * %x/%u/%l* each cost a few words of printf's own reachable-call-graph
 * weight (print_hex/print_long/print_uint32/u32_and_nz, all pulled in
 * unconditionally the moment any program calls printf at all, whether
 * it uses these specifiers or not) — same shared 256-word page-zero
 * budget %f was kept out of printf for (see this file's next comment).
 * Confirmed empirically: a program combining atof() with even a bare
 * printf("%d", n) can tip over that budget where it fit before this
 * printf was extended, even though atof() and printf() individually
 * still fit fine — if that happens, replace the printf call with
 * putchar()/puts() (no extra weight) to get back under budget.

 * every program on this target, and wiring float formatting into its
 * '%f' case would make the *entire* soft-float runtime (eclipse_rt.c's
 * "soft float" section — sf_add, __mulsf3, __fixsfsi, ...) statically
 * reachable from any program that calls printf at all, whether it uses
 * %f or not, permanently consuming this target's shared 256-word
 * page-zero budget. Confirmed empirically: even printf("%d\n", 42)
 * failed to assemble once %f lived inside printf's switch. Call this
 * directly instead: print_float(3.5f) rather than printf("%f", 3.5f).
 * No extra opt-in needed beyond just calling it — non-float programs
 * that never call print_float still pay nothing for its existence.
 * Returns nothing (unlike printf, no character count) — dropping that
 * bookkeeping was part of what got this under the ±127-word per-
 * function frame limit; see print_float's own comment in eclipse_rt.c.
